onia or Dexter, from the year 1261, while the name of Delamer, the
founder of Multifernan is not mentioned.

The Editor has not considered it necessary to comment on any
of the events recorded, except such as relate to Ireland, and on these

he has been as brief as possible, restricting his remarks chiefly to the

discrepancies between these Annals and the authorities most gene·
rally received.
The text has been printed as nearly in accordante with the ori-

ginal as circumstances would permit. The contracted words have
been in general restored to their full length3 but the Editor has not

ventured to do so in any instance in which he might incur the risk
of corrupting the text. The few interpolatione inserted bya later
hand in the MS. are printed in Italics, and such emendations as have
been introduced by the Editor are placed between brackets.
